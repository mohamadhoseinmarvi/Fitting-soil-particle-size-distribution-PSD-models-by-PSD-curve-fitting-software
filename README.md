# Fitting-soil-particle-size-distribution-PSD-models-by-PSD-curve-fitting-software
This paper describes a particle-size distribution (PSD) curve fitting software for analyzing the soil PSD and soil physical properties. A better characterization of soil texture can be obtained by describing the soil PSD using mathematical models. The mathematical equations of soil PSD are mainly used as a basis to estimate the soil hydraulic properties. Until now, many attempts are made to represent PSD curves using mathematical models, but selecting the best PSD model requires fitting all models to the PSD data, which would be difficult and time-consuming. So far, no specific program has been developed to fit the PSD models to the experimental data. A practical user-friendly software called “PSD Curve Fitting Software” was developed and introduced to program a simultaneous fitting of all models to soil PSD data of all samples. Some of the capabilities of this software are calculating evaluation statistics for all models and soils and their statistical properties such as average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for all models, the amount of models’ fitting parameters and their statistical properties for all soil samples, soil water retention curve by Arya and Paris (1981) and Meskini-Vishkaee et al.
